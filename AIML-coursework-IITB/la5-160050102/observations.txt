Task 3:
For lasso, I had first compared for 0,200*1000 and then 200*1000,400*1000 and then 400*1000,600*1000 so then I found that
minimum occurs at around 340000

For ridge i had started from 0,10 and then 10,20 and found that minimum occurs at 12. 

Lasso : From the plots,
		lambda = 340000 (approx)
		SSE = 533598682638.3136
		max_iterations = 2000
		splits = 6


Ridge : From the plots,
		lamda = 12 (approx)
		SSE = 540434270211.07745
		max_iter=30000
		lr=0.00001
		epsilon = 1e-4
		splits = 6

Task 5:

Lasso has sparse points than compared to ridge as lasso doesn't take axes that seriously.The solution from lasso contains more zeros than ridge,i.e,along axes and lasso disregards useless features.It removes the over-fitting problem. As, we are less concerned with the unnecessary features, the sse would be lesser and hence we get lesser value compared to ridge.
